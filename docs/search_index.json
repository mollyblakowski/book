[["plotting-data-with-ggplot.html", "Chapter 3 Plotting data with ggplot", " Chapter 3 Plotting data with ggplot In the literature, the most common way to visualize \\(\\epsilon\\)205Tl is plotted against 1/Tl concentration (ppm), so this is why I made the merged sheet during my last stage of cleaning. Thanks to recent practice from class assignments, plotting the data to share with my collaborators was the easieast part. # load packages library(tidyverse) library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(knitr) # remind RMarkdown that iso_el = merged_data.csv (had some trouble with this) iso_el &lt;- read.csv(&quot;merged_data.csv&quot;) # Tl isotope and 1/Tl plot (note to self: low Tl conc outlier cropped out in this version) tl_plot &lt;- iso_el %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Tl_inv, y = mean, col = combined_names)) + geom_point(aes(shape = month)) + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - sd2, ymax = mean + sd2), width = .2)+ theme_light() + labs(x = &quot;1/Tl (ppm)&quot;, y = &quot;expression(epsilon)&quot;, col = &quot;Site&quot;, shape = &quot;Month&quot;) + theme(legend.position = c(0.85,0.3)) + xlim(0, 20) + ggsave(filename = &quot;tl_plot.tiff&quot;, device = &quot;tiff&quot;, width = 8, height = 8, units = &quot;in&quot;, dpi = 400) tl_plot # hopefully insert the plot... it&#39;s taking forever to load! knitr::include_graphics(&quot;tl_plot.tiff&quot;) Figure 3.1: The plot. My next step is to figure out how to get \\(\\epsilon\\)205Tl on my axis label correctly. :) "]]
